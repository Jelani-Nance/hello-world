My introduction to GitHub

Hello World!

My name is Jelani (Jay) and I am FINALLY getting myself familiar with GitHub!
I feel I am worth committing myself to learning code and becoming very fluid with my learning.
I am excited to see where this will take me and I am continuing to gain as much knowledge as I can to become the best progammer I can be.
